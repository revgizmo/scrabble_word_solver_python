# AI Implementation Prompt: Scrabble Word Solver Grouping & Sorting Enhancement

## Context

I have a Flask-based Scrabble word solver web application that I want to enhance with advanced grouping and sorting features. The application is fully functional and deployed, but I need to add the ability to group words by length, first letter, and last letter, with various sorting options.

## Current Application State

### Current Features
- ✅ Word generation from input letters using permutations
- ✅ Scrabble score calculation using official letter values
- ✅ Dictionary validation (466,550+ words)
- ✅ Web interface with modern Bootstrap 5 design
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- ✅ API endpoints for programmatic access
- ✅ Heroku deployment ready

### Current API Response Format
```json
{
  "letters": "aetrs",
  "total_words": 64,
  "words": [
    {
      "word": "aster",
      "score": 5,
      "length": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current Frontend
- Clean, modern interface with Bootstrap 5
- Letter input with validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Results displayed as individual word items with scores
- Copy functionality for individual words

## Enhancement Requirements

I need to add the following features to my existing Scrabble word solver:

### 1. Grouping Capabilities
- **By Word Length**: Group words by number of letters (2-letter, 3-letter, 4-letter, etc.)
- **By First Letter**: Group words alphabetically by first letter
- **By Last Letter**: Group words alphabetically by last letter
- **Combined Grouping**: Allow multiple grouping criteria

### 2. Sorting Features
- **Within Groups**: Sort by score (descending) or alphabetically within each group
- **Group Order**: Sort groups by criteria (length ascending/descending, alphabetical)
- **Secondary Sort**: Allow secondary sorting criteria

### 3. UI Enhancements
- **Group Headers**: Clear visual separation between groups with statistics
- **Collapsible Groups**: Allow users to expand/collapse groups
- **Group Statistics**: Show count and total score per group
- **Filtering**: Allow filtering by word length and letter position
- **View Toggle**: Switch between grouped and flat view

## Detailed Implementation Plan

I have created a comprehensive implementation plan in the file `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` that includes:

- **Technical Implementation Plan**: Backend and frontend changes
- **API Specification**: Enhanced endpoints and response formats
- **UI Mockups**: Visual design for grouped results
- **File Structure Changes**: New files and modifications needed
- **Implementation Phases**: Step-by-step development approach
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and user acceptance tests

## Key Technical Requirements

### Backend Changes Needed
1. **Enhanced Data Model**: Add `first_letter` and `last_letter` to word objects
2. **Grouping Logic**: Create functions to group words by various criteria
3. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement flexible sorting for groups and within groups
4. **API Enhancement**: Update `/solve` endpoint with grouping parameters
5. **Filtering**: Add filtering by length and letter position

### Frontend Changes Needed
1. **Form Controls**: Add dropdowns for grouping, sorting, and filtering options
2. **Results Display**: Create group headers and collapsible sections
3. **Interactive Features**: Dynamic filtering, sort toggles, copy group functionality
4. **CSS Enhancements**: Styling for groups, animations, and visual hierarchy

### New API Response Format
```json
{
  "letters": "aetrs",
  "total_words": 64,
  "grouping": {
    "type": "length",
    "sort_order": "asc",
    "groups": [
      {
        "name": "5 letters",
        "count": 6,
        "total_score": 30,
        "words": [
          {
            "word": "aster",
            "score": 5,
            "length": 5,
            "first_letter": "a",
            "last_letter": "r"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Approach

Please implement this enhancement following these guidelines:

### 1. Preserve Existing Functionality
- All current features must continue to work
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Keep the current UI as a "flat view" option

### 2. Modular Implementation
- Create separate utility modules for grouping and sorting logic
- Keep the main app.py clean and well-organized
- Use clear separation between backend logic and frontend presentation

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic grouping by length
- Add sorting options incrementally
- Implement filtering as a final enhancement

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Optimize grouping algorithms for large word sets
- Implement efficient sorting for real-time updates
- Consider client-side caching for better responsiveness

### 5. User Experience
- Maintain the clean, modern design aesthetic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is preserved
- Add smooth animations and transitions
- Provide clear visual feedback for all interactions

## Specific Tasks

Please implement the following in order:

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
1. **Update `scrabble_solver.py`**: Add functions to extract first/last letters
2. **Create `utils/grouping.py`**: Implement grouping logic functions
3. **Create `utils/sorting.py`**: Implement sorting algorithms
4. **Update `app.py`**: Enhance the `/solve` endpoint with grouping parameters
5. **Add unit tests**: Test all new functions thoroughly

### Phase 2: Frontend Enhancement
1. **Update `templates/index.html`**: Add grouping controls and group display
2. **Enhance `static/js/app.js`**: Add grouping functionality and interactions
3. **Update `static/css/style.css`**: Add group styling and animations
4. **Test UI**: Ensure all interactions work smoothly

### Phase 3: Polish and Testing
1. **Performance optimization**: Optimize algorithms and add caching
2. **Cross-browser testing**: Ensure compatibility
3. **Mobile testing**: Verify responsive design
4. **Documentation**: Update README with new features

## Success Criteria

The implementation should achieve:

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Words can be grouped by length, first letter, and last letter
- ✅ Groups can be sorted in ascending or descending order
- ✅ Words within groups can be sorted by score or alphabetically
- ✅ Users can filter by word length and letter position
- ✅ Groups can be expanded/collapsed
- ✅ Group statistics are displayed
- ✅ Copy functionality works for individual words and groups
- ✅ View toggle between grouped and flat display

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Grouping operations complete in < 100ms for typical inputs
- ✅ UI remains responsive during filtering and sorting
- ✅ Memory usage remains reasonable for large word sets

### User Experience Requirements
- ✅ Interface is intuitive and easy to use
- ✅ Visual feedback is provided for all interactions
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- ✅ Accessibility standards are met

## Additional Context

- **Target Users**: Scrabble players who want to analyze their word options strategically
- **Use Case**: Players want to quickly find high-scoring words of specific lengths or starting/ending with certain letters
- **Performance**: The app should handle inputs up to 15 letters efficiently
- **Compatibility**: Must work on modern browsers and mobile devices

## Questions for Implementation

1. Should I implement all grouping types simultaneously or start with one?
2. What's the best approach for handling the transition between flat and grouped views?
3. How should I handle edge cases like empty groups or single-word groups?
4. What's the optimal way to implement the collapsible functionality?
5. Should I add any additional features beyond the core grouping requirements?

Please implement this enhancement following the detailed plan in `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`, maintaining the existing code quality and user experience while adding these powerful new capabilities.
