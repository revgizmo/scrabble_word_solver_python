# Short AI Prompt for Implementation

## Copy and paste this into a new AI chat:

---

**"I have a Flask-based Scrabble word solver web application that I want to enhance with advanced grouping and sorting features. I've created two comprehensive documents that contain all the necessary context and implementation details:**

**1. 'ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md' - Contains the complete technical implementation plan, API specifications, UI mockups, file structure changes, and implementation phases**

**2. 'AI_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md' - Contains the full application context, current state analysis, detailed requirements, and specific implementation guidelines**

**The enhancement will add the ability to group words by length, first letter, and last letter, with various sorting options and filtering capabilities. Please implement this enhancement following the detailed plans in both documents, maintaining the existing code quality and user experience while adding these powerful new capabilities. The current application is fully functional with a modern Bootstrap 5 interface, API endpoints, and Heroku deployment configuration."**

## Alternative shorter version:

**"I have a Flask Scrabble word solver that needs grouping/sorting features. I've documented everything in 'ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md' (technical plan) and 'AI_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md' (full context). Please implement the enhancement following both documents to add word grouping by length/first/last letter with sorting and filtering options."**
